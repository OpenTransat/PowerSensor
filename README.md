# Power Sensor

* Measures voltage &amp; current of each solar panel separately

* Measures voltage &amp; current of a (backup) battery

* Uses INA219 for measurement

* Communicates via I2C

There are two thermally isolated regions on the PCB as the Schottky diodes generate heat. The PCB will be potted in a heat conductive epoxy while keeping the regions isolated. The potted Power Sensor will be attached to aluminum structure that will be cooled down by the surrounding water.
